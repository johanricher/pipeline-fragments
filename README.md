# Pipeline fragments

Reusable fragments of [LinkedPipes ETL](http://etl.linkedpipes.com) pipelines for automating repeating tasks in processing fiscal data. The pipeline fragments can be imported from their URLs that are listed in their documentation.

The inputs and outputs of each pipeline fragment are documented in the fragment's directory. The components of the pipeline fragments that require input or configuration are **highlighted by red**.
