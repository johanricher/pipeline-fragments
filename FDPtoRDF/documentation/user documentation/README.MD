# Transforming Fiscal Data Package into RDF
User documentation

After saving the data package in [OS-packager](http://next.openspending.org/packager), at the confirmation page, click the ```Manage your datasets``` button (see in the screenshot below).

That should take you to a page with an overview of all datasets you uploaded through the OS-packager. You can also get there directly at any time, the app is called [OS-admin](http://next.openspending.org/admin).

Find the data package you just uploaded, hover over the "three dots" button next to it and click the ```Run external hooks``` button (see the screenshot below).

That's it. Now the transformation to RDF will be performed in the background (it can take a few minutes) and after that, the dataset will be available in the OpenBudgets platform.
